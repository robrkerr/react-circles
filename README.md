# Animating circles in React

## The challenge

There are 1053 data points in a file called 'circles.json'. Each has a row and
a column and we want to display them as small circles in our app. We also want
to be able to toggle between showing all of the circles, arranged in their rows
and columns, and only a single row of circles (row 5), arranged in a circle
themselves. Importantly, we want to animate the circles changing between these
configurations, so that they smoothly move between their two different positions.
When only row 5 is shown, circles above row 5 should move to a position above the
screen, and those below row 5 should move to a position below the screen.

## Discussion points

- How would you test this code?
- How is it performing (in terms of FPS)? How would you debug this?
- What alternatives are there and what are the pros and cons?
